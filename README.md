# An MQTT sample app subscribes and publishes to ARTIK Cloud

Let's build a Java console application that communicates to ARTIK Cloud [MQTT endpoint](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/data-management/mqtt.html) using ARTIK Cloud's [Java/Android SDK](https://github.com/artikcloud/artikcloud-java). This app emulates a smart light, which turns on or off based on Actions from ARTIK Cloud and sends the latest state (on or off) back to ARTIK Cloud.

After completing this sample, you will learn:

- How to [establish an MQTT session](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/data-management/mqtt.html#establish-an-mqtt-session) with ARTIK Cloud.
- How to [subscribe](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/data-management/mqtt.html#subscribe-to-receive-actions) to receive Actions.
- How to [publish messages](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/data-management/mqtt.html#publish-data-only-messages).

## Requirements
- Java version >= 1.8
- Apache Maven >= 3.3.9

## Setup / Installation

### Setup at ARTIK Cloud

 1. At My ARTIK Cloud, [connect a device](https://my.artik.cloud/new_device/cloud.artik.example.simple_smartlight) of the type "Example Simple Smart Light" (unique type name `cloud.artik.example.simple_smartlight`). You can use the one that you already own.
 2. Get the [device ID and token](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/tools/web-tools.html#managing-a-device-token). You will need them when running the console app (smart light emulator). 
 
### Setup Java project

 1. Clone this repository if you haven't already done so.

 2. At the root directory and run the command:
    ~~~shell
    mvn clean package
    ~~~
    The executable `mqtt-smartlight-x.x.jar` is generated under the target directory. 

 3. Run the command at the target directory to learn the usage:
    ~~~shell
    java -jar mqtt-smartlight-x.x.jar
    ~~~

## Demo

 1. Start the smart light emulator. Run the command at the target directory: 
    ~~~shell
    java -jar mqtt-smartlight-x.x.jar -d YOUR_DEVICE_ID -t YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN
    ~~~
   Remember that you got the device ID and token of your smart light in the ARTIK Cloud setup phase.

 2. Send Actions to the emulator using the [web tool](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/tutorials/an-iot-remote-control.html#test-the-light) at My ARTIK Cloud.

 3. The emulator terminal should show that Actions are received from the subscribed topic and updated states (on or off) are published back to ARTIK Cloud. The following is the example:
    ~~~shell
    Start mqtt session....
    Connecting to broker: ssl://api.artik.cloud:8883......
    Succeeded: CONNECT

    Subscribing to topic: /v1.1/actions/7d469......
    Succeeded: SUBSCRIB
    Subscribed to topic: /v1.1/actions/7d469

    Received message. Payload: {"actions":[{"name":"setOn"}]}; Topic:/v1.1/actions/7d469; Qos:0
    Handle Action: setOn
    Set State to true
    Publishing to topic: /v1.1/messages/7d469; message payload: {"state":true}; QoS:2.....
    Succeeded: PUBLISH
    Published to topic: /v1.1/messages/7d469

    Received message. Payload: {"actions":[{"name":"setOff"}]}; Topic:/v1.1/actions/7d469; Qos:0
    Handle Action: setOff
    Set State to false
    Publishing to topic: /v1.1/messages/7d469; message payload: {"state":false}; QoS:2.....
    Succeeded: PUBLISH
    Published to topic: /v1.1/messages/7d469
    ~~~

 4. Enter Ctrl+C to terminate the console application as following:
    ~~~
    ^C
    Prepare shutting down. Disconnecting... Please wait...
    Succeeded: DISCONNECT
    ~~~
